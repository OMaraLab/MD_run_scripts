; This is a new template mdp file for gromos 54A7 membrane simulations. Developed by Yumeng, Wenbai and Megan together at 7th Nov 2023. This is for production run 500 ns in an NPT ensemble. This mdp is using reaction-feild and shake.

;lincs-order = 4 
;  Highest order in the expansion of the constraint coupling matrix. When constraints form triangles, an additional expansion of the same order is applied on top of the normal expansion only for the couplings within such triangles. For “normal” MD simulations an order of 4 usually suffices, 6 is needed for large time-steps with virtual sites.

;lincs-iter = 1
;Number of iterations to correct for rotational lengthening in LINCS. For normal runs a single step is sufficient, but for NVE runs where you want to conserve energy accurately or for accurate energy minimization in double precision you might want to increase it to 2. Note that in single precision using more than 1 iteration will often lead to worse accuracy due to amplification of rounding errors.
