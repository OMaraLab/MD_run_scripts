# About these scripts

These scripts are for specialised use cases, where a user requires a specific version of gromacs, or a specific configuration.  

They are not optimised.  The performance of these scripts is usually bad.

Only use these scripts if you have a specific reason, and know what you are doing.

They are here because I occasionally need them for continuity with old projects.
